battery by Ragnar (some stuff has modded to make more compatible with omnibots)
    * Axis can rebuild the Backdoor. Allies need dynamite to destroy the Backdoor.
    * Axis can spawn near the backdoor as long as the Axis command post is up and running (this is different from the ETPro map script where Axis spawn at the command post).
    * The command post and Axis MG nests are already built on map start.
    * The Generator and the Backdoor are decoupled, so the Generator does not open or close the Backdoor - it does only operate the doors near the Gun resp. the door at the bunker front.
    * The MG42 nests in the East Bunker (near the Command Post) are removed.
    * Frontline mod (see below for description).
    * The script includes all ETPro map script fixes.
    * The script includes mortis' script fixes for Battery.

fueldump 
In addition to all etpro features and setting of the allied autospawn to the cp at spline 73, Player clips block all trickjumps into fueldump. 2 axis spawns are enabled in the Axis truck garage.

goldrush
fixed invisible sinking player cheat

oasis
Mapscript removes the teamdoor at the old city wall after the wall is breached (by nUllSkillZ), fixed map bugs, falling deaths

radar
Fixes wm_endround waitstate.

railgun 
Players were using an exploit to hide inside of a watertank in the depot yard. The tank on ledge above the depot yard now has a solid playerclip inside it. The edge may seem a bit 'sticky' if you encroach on the fakebrush. A trigger_hurt lies inside to damage exploiters who exploit past the clip in etpub.
+ 6 tower spawns.
