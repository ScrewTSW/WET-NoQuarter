Folder WINDOWS contain the files needed to compile and run 
ET + LUA under Windows ( VS 2008 EE )

The .h file and the .hpp are included in the ET server project, same for
the two .lib files, and are used to compile the game.

The two .dll files needs to be placed in the same folder where you have the
ETDED.exe, and are needed to run the game.

Folder LINUX contain the files needed to compile and run
ET + LUA under Linux ( Scons )

Un-zip the archive "libs.zip" in order to have in the LINUX folder the
files liblua5.1.a and liblua5.1.so

The first one is needed to compile the game, the second one you've to copy
where you have the ETDED.run.
