</h2><h2>Description</h2>
<p>ETWsk aims to reduce spawnkilling (SK) on public funservers. An SK here is if
someone kills an enemy near a fix spawn point. A fix spawn point means that
it can not be cleared by the enemy. E.g. on radar map, the allied Side Gate 
spawn is not fix as the axis can destroy the command post. However, the Main
Bunker spawn is fix after the Allies have destroyed the Main Gate. ETWsk does
not prevent but it detects and counts SKs for every player. If a player has
caused a certain number of SKs, he gets punished (putspec, kick, ban, ...).
As the detection of fix spawns is difficult especially on custom maps, little
configuration work has to be done.</p>

<h3>Features:</h3>
<ul><li>
circular protection areas around spawn points</li><li>
two protection radius can be defined: heavy weapons and normal weapons</li><li>
the spawn protection expires when a player hurts an enemy (can be disabled)</li><li>
fully configurable for individual maps: fixing radius; adding actions
that change protected areas during the game; adding new protection
areas.</li><li>
client console commands for stats and help for configuration</li><li>
no RunFrame() -&gt; low server load</li>
</ul>

<h2>Changelog</h2>
<ul>
<li>0.8: Map connfigs outsourced to own files.</li><li>
</li><li>0.7: Added kill as punishment for the first few SKs.</li>
<li>0.6: Added kick as punishment. </li>
<li>0.5: Added additional warning for spawnkiller. </li>
<li>0.4: Added map customization with transitions, added putspec as punishment. </li>
<li>0.3: Use origin of WOLF_objective entity as default center of protected area.</li>
<li>0.2: Compare killer and victim team. Self- and team-kill is not spawnkill. </li>
</ul>

<h2>Installation</h2>
<ol>
<li>Download ETWsk.zip and extract it in the etpro subfolder.</li>
<li>Edit your server config file and add following cvar:<br>
<code>set lua_modules "ETWsk.lua"</code><br>

If you already have one or more lua modules you can add them separated by a space like<br>
<code>"ETWsk.lua otherscript.lua"</code></li>
<li>Reset the server (<code>reset_match</code> is sufficient).</li>
</ol>

<h2>Configuration</h2>
Create a simple text file named as "mapname".lua and copy it to your mapSpawns folder. The general format
for adding custom map settings is:
<pre><code>
local c = {spawns = {}, actions = {}, defaults = true}
		&lt;spawn definitions&gt;
		&lt;action definitions&gt;
return c
</code></pre>

where:
<pre><code>
spawn definitions:
     c.spawn[&lt;spawn-num&gt;] = {&lt;spawn-fields&gt;}
spawn-num: spawn index (see /etwsk_spawns command)
spawn-fields: - comma-separated list of "key = value"
              - for existing spawns all fields are optional (they overwrite default values).
              - fields:
                    name = &lt;String&gt;  : name of spawn point
                    state = NO_PROTECT|PROTECT_ALLIES|PROTECT_AXIS
                    pos = {x,y,z}    : map coordinates of spawn point 
                    radius1 = &lt;Int&gt;  : protection radius for normal weapons
                    radius2 = &lt;Int&gt;  : protection radius for heavy weapons
action definitions: actions are definitions of transitions of one state of a spawn point into another one triggered by a message.
     c.action[&lt;ction-num&gt;] = {&lt;action-fields&gt;}
action-num: just an increment number
action-fields: - comma-separated list of "key = value"
                   - all fields are mandatory
                   - fields:
                       spawn = &lt;pawn-num&gt;
                       newstate = NO_PROTECT|PROTECT_ALLIES|PROTECT_AXIS
                       trigger = &lt;String&gt;: part of a message that is displayed  by the server on a specific event.
</code></pre>       
<h4>adding new protection areas to maps</h4>
<ol><li>
enter the map and walk to the location where you want to add the area</li><li>
type /etwsk_spawns and remember the highest spawn index number</li><li>
type /etwsk_pos and write down the coordinates</li><li>
add spawn to config with at least the name,state and pos field</li>
</ol>
<h4>default values</h4>
At mapstart, ETWsk scans for all spawnpoints and sets the state either
to PROTECT_ALLIES or PROTECT_AXIS. It also scans for capturable flag
poles and sets the state of a spawnpoint near a flag pole to
NO_PROTECT. The location of a spawnpoint is taken from the
WOLF_objective entity, the small spawn flag that can be selected in the
command map. This entity is usually placed in the center of the
individual player-spawnpoints. However, on some maps this is not the
case. Check the positions of the small spawn flags on the command map
or type /etwsk_pos after you have spawned to check the distance to
protected areas. If needed, adjust the radius, or the pos or add a new
protection area to the map. If you wish to set all protection areas
manually in a map, add:
<pre><code>
    c.defaults = false
</code></pre> 
 to the definitions for a map.
