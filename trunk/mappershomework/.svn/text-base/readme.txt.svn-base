Notes for editing mappers homework
*******************************************************************************
- If you edit mapscript files make sure you don't change original announcers. 
  Otherwise the omni-bots can't manage their goals. 
  Please mark the script as non usable for bots if you do.

- IMPORTANT:
  This pack is to fix map issues containing a mapscript and additional assets 
  to solve issues. If you don't need additional assets to repair a map put the 
  script into trunk/mapsscripts/maps.
