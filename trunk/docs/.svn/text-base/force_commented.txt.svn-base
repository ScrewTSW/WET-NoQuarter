// force.cfg file forces some client cvars to current default values.
// Client CVARs are NOT re-set if clients download a new mod version
// and the mod is already installed.
// We don't want to rename CVARs which is as alternative
// instead just set g_ForceCvarFile "force.cfg" in your NQ config. 

// Feel free to add any other forcecvar commands in force.cfg but keep in mind they are 
// part of the configstring! (MAX_GAMECHARS). If you run into trouble you know why.

// Fixes SMG/dual preselection issue
