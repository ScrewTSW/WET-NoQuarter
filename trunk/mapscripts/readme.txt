  you do bug reports please mention you are using these custom scripts.

Notes for editing mapscripts
*******************************************************************************
- If you edit mapscript files make sure you don't change original announcers. 
  Otherwise the omni-bots can't manage their goals. 
  Please mark the script as non usable for bots if you do.

- Please do not add scripts where other files need to be delivered. 
  This pack is server side only.
